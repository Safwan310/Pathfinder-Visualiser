Note: This is a visualiser tool for Pathfinding algorithms. Currently, it visualises Dijkstra's algorithm only. 

Functioning: Green Node depicts the Start node, and red node depicts the end/goal node.

Black boxes represent walls or obstacles, which can be made by dragging your cursor on the grid. 

Click on 'Generate Dijkstra's algorithm' button to watch the visualisation.
